I created a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml for my cloned ohtuvarasto repository. In the Dockerfile, I first pull python:3.12-slim as the base image. Directory as this app, and I run an install of Poetry with pip. I copy pyproject.toml and poetry.lock in the directory. Then we need to run an install of the Poetry dependencies with Poetry install, specifying not to install the project itself as a dependency. Then we copy the rest with the COPY . . line. At this point we can install the Poetry project itself without the earlier specification. Then the command is for python to run the index.py. The docker-compose.yml is very simple and just gives the same command in the same directory for Dockerfile. Then we can run docker compose up --build in CLI which just runs the index.py in the container.
